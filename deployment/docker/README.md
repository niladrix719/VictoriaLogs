`vlinsert` and `vlselect` are available through `vmauth` at `http://localhost:8427`.
For example, `vector` pushes logs via `http://localhost:8427/insert/elasticsearch/` path,
and Grafana queries `http://localhost:8427` for datasource queries.

In addition to VictoriaLogs cluster, the docker compose contains the following components:
* [vector](https://vector.dev/guides/) service for collecting docker logs and sending them to `vlinsert`;
* [Grafana](#grafana) is configured with [VictoriaLogs datasource](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/victorialogs-datasource) and pointing to `vmauth`.
* [VictoriaMetrics single-node](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/) to collect metrics from all the components;
* `vlinsert` fo sending the ingested logs to `vlstorage`;
* `vlselect` for querying `vlstorage`;
* [vmauth](#vmauth) balances incoming read and write requests among `vlselect`s and `vlinsert`s;
* [vmalert](#vmalert) is configured to query `vlselect`s, and send alerts state
  and recording rules results to `VictoriaMetrics single-node`;
* [alertmanager](#alertmanager) is configured to receive notifications from `vmalert`.

# Common components

## vmauth

[vmauth](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/vmauth/) acts as a [load balancer](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/vmauth/#load-balancing)
to spread the load across `vlselect` nodes. [Grafana](#grafana) and [vmalert](#vmalert) use vmauth for read queries.
vmauth routes read queries to VictoriaLogs depending on requested path.
See vmauth config [for VictoriaLogs single-server](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/blob/master/deployment/docker/auth-vl-single.yml) and
[for VictoriaLogs cluster](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/blob/master/deployment/docker/auth-vl-cluster.yml).

## vmalert

[vmalert](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/vmalert/) evaluates [these alerting rules](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/blob/master/deployment/docker/rules).
It queries VictoriaLogs and sends alerts to AlertManager. It also stores alerting state to VictoriaMetrics.

vmalert is available at [http://localhost:8880/](http://localhost:8880/).

## alertmanager

AlertManager accepts notifications from `vmalert` and fires alerts.
All notifications are blackholed according to [alertmanager.yml](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/blob/master/deployment/docker/alertmanager.yml) config.

AlertManager is available at [http://localhost:9093/](http://localhost:9093/).

## Grafana

Grafana is available at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

Default credentials:
* login: `admin`
* password: `admin`

Grafana is provisioned with default dashboards and datasources.

## Alerts

See below a list of recommended alerting rules for VictoriaLogs components for running in production.
Some alerting rules thresholds are just recommendations and could require an adjustment.
The list of alerting rules is the following:
* [alerts-health.yml](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/blob/master/deployment/docker/rules/alerts-health.yml):
  shared alerting rules for tracking the health of VictoriaLogs components;
* [alerts-vlogs.yml](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/blob/master/deployment/docker/rules/alerts-vlogs.yml):
  [VictoriaLogs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/)-specific alerting rules for VictoriaLogs installations. Load this together with `alerts-health.yml`;
* [alerts-vlagent.yml](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs/blob/master/deployment/docker/rules/alerts-vlagent.yml):
  alerting rules related to [vlagent](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/vlagent/). Load this together with `alerts-health.yml`.

Please, also see [how to monitor VictoriaLogs installations](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/#monitoring).

## Troubleshooting

This environment has the following requirements:
* installed [docker compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/);
* access to the Internet for downloading docker images;
* **All commands should be executed from the root directory of [the VictoriaLogs repo](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs).**

Containers are started in [--detach mode](https://docs.docker.com/reference/cli/docker/compose/up/), meaning they run in the background. 
As a result, you won't see their logs or exit status directly in the terminal.

If something isn’t working as expected, try the following troubleshooting steps:
1. Run from the correct directory. Make sure you're running the command from the root of the [VictoriaLogs repository](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaLogs).
2. Check container status. Run `docker ps -a` to list all containers and their status. Healthy and running containers should have `STATUS` set to `Up`.
3. View container logs. To inspect logs for a specific container, get its container ID from step p2 and run: `docker logs -f <containerID>`.
4. Read the logs carefully and follow any suggested actions.
5. Check for port conflicts. Some containers (e.g., Grafana) expose HTTP ports. If a port (like `:3000`) is already in use, the container may fail to start. Stop the conflicting process or change the exposed port in the Docker Compose file.
6. Shut down the deployment. To tear down the environment, run: `make <environment>-down` (i.e. `make docker-vl-single-down`). 
   Note, this command also removes all attached volumes, so all the temporary created data will be removed too (i.e. Grafana dashboards or collected metrics).
